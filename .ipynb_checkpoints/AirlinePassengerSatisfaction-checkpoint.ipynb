    "This dataset represents airline passenger satisfaction survey results that were collected to evaluate factors that influence passenger satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It includes various aspects of the travel experience, such as inflight services, online booking, and airport conveniences. Each passenger's satisfaction is rated based on multiple features, including flight distance, class, inflight wifi service, departure/arrival time convenience, ease of online booking, gate location, food and drink quality, online boarding, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, on-board service, legroom, baggage handling, check-in service, inflight service, cleanliness, and any departure or arrival delays, along with demographic information like age, gender, and customer loyalty. These features collectively offer a detailed view of the factors that contribute to overall passenger satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset originates from an airline survey and is designed to assess the correlation between passenger satisfaction and specific services provided during air travel. The satisfaction outcomes are categorized as \"satisfied\" or \"neutral or dissatisfied.\" This offers valuable insight into which factors most strongly affect customer experience, helping airlines optimize their services.\n",

    "The objective of this project is to conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover the underlying patterns, distributions, and correlations within the airline passenger satisfaction dataset. By analyzing various aspects of the passenger journey, we aim to identify key factors that influence satisfaction and dissatisfaction levels. Ultimately, this analysis could be used to predict passenger satisfaction and suggest improvements to airline services. This will allow the airline to prioritize the factors that affect customer satisfaction and make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploration will serve as a foundation for further predictive modeling and customer experience optimization."

    "### EDA Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Having worked in the hospitality industry before, I was always curious about the airline department in my previous organization. This sparked a personal interest in exploring how airlines measure and improve customer satisfaction. I see this project as an opportunity to make an impact in the airline industry by understanding the key drivers of passenger satisfaction and dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Research Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What factors most strongly correlate with passenger satisfaction?** I am interested in identifying the most significant drivers of passenger satisfaction, such as inflight wifi service, seat comfort, or baggage handling, to understand what airlines should prioritize for improving the passenger experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do delays (departure and arrival) impact overall passenger satisfaction?** Since delays can be a common pain point in air travel, I am curious about how much of an impact they have on passenger satisfaction and whether other service aspects can compensate for the inconvenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does the satisfaction level vary by passenger age group?** Understanding how different age demographics perceive airline services can help tailor marketing strategies and service offerings, ensuring that airlines meet the diverse needs of their passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions will guide my exploratory data analysis where I will aiming to derive actionable insights for enhancing the airline customer experience. As I delve deeper into the dataset, I might also analyze additional factors, such as interactions between multiple service features, or trends within specific customer segments, to uncover deeper insights and potential areas for improvement in airline operations and customer satisfaction strategies."
