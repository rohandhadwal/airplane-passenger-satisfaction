# airplane-passenger-satisfaction

This project focuses on analyzing factors influencing airline passenger satisfaction using a structured approach to exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset contains various features such as demographic details, travel details, and service ratings. 

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to identify the key factors driving passenger satisfaction through detailed analysis of the dataset. By leveraging univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, the project uncovers patterns and trends that can guide business decisions for improving customer experiences.

## Key Features of the Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis**: Examined individual variables like passenger age, flight distance, and service ratings to understand their distributions.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between two variables, such as the correlation between flight distance and satisfaction or the impact of delays on customer experience.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigated complex interactions among multiple variables, such as the combined effect of inflight entertainment and seat comfort on satisfaction.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Used heatmaps to identify factors most strongly correlated with satisfaction, highlighting areas for improvement.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified outliers in variables like flight delays and flight distances to improve data quality.
- **Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- Online boarding, inflight entertainment, and seat comfort are the top drivers of passenger satisfaction.
- Satisfaction increases with age, peaking in the 46-60 age group, but decreases for older passengers.
- Longer flight distances show a moderate positive correlation with satisfaction, but age does not strongly influence flight preferences.
- Delays negatively impact satisfaction, reinforcing the importance of minimizing wait times.

## Future Work
- Further EDA on categorical features like customer type and travel class.
- Outlier removal for better data quality.
- Dimensionality reduction to enhance computational efficiency.
- Building classification models to predict passenger satisfaction based on key features.
